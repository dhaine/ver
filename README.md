The exercises in the book
[Veterinary Epidemiologic Research](http://www.upei.ca/ver/welcome "Veterinary
Epidemiologic Research") by Ian Dohoo, Wayne Martin, and Henrik Stryhn were
realized with either SAS or Stata (mainly). Here are the same exercises but done
with R, as on my blog (starting [here](http://denishaine.wordpress.com/2013/02/)
"Denis Haine's blog").

You will find:
* linear regression (ch. 13)
* logistic regression (ch. 16)
* modelling count and rate data (ch. 18)
* modelling survival data (ch. 19)

Note that results might sometimes not be exactly the same as in the book, as the
dataset might have changes from the time the book was written and the data sets
were put on the book's website (Ian Dohoo, pers. comm.).
